# gnome-builder python plugins



## About

A set of **gnome-builder** extensions for Python development.

##### global requirements:

- gnome-builder >= 3.32
- Python >=3.6



## Installing

This project uses the [meson build system](http://mesonbuild.com/). Run the following commands to clone this project and initialize the build:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gravure-dtp/gnome-builder-python-plugins.git
$ cd gnome-builder-python-plugins
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local
```

Note: `build` is the build output directory and can be changed to any other
directory name.

To build or re-build after code-changes, run:

```
$ meson --reconfigure --prefix=~/.local build
```

To install, run:

```
$ meson compile -C build
$ meson install -C build
```



## Install only specific plugins

You can specify with the -Dplugins configure option a list of plugin(s) to install:

```
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local -Dplugins=python-linter,python-517-build
```



## Flatpak specific installation

To install plugins for your gnome-builder flatpak's distribution:

```
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local -Dflatpak=true
$ meson compile -C build
$ meson install -C build
```

Note: this will only install certains files to the flatpak container (because thoses files can't be share with user space)



To show Python installed packages in your gnome-builder flatpak's distribution:

```
$ pip freeze --path ~/.local/share/flatpak/app/org.gnome.Builder/current/active/files/lib/python3.9/site-packages
```

To install or upgrade a specific Python requirement to your gnome-builder flatpak's distribution:

```
pip install packaging>=20.9 --upgrade -t ~/.local/share/flatpak/app/org.gnome.Builder/current/active/files/lib/python3.9/site-packages
```



## python-517 plugin

Provide a modern python build system defined through the [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/#build-requirements) (a build-system independent format for source trees). This is also well known as the [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) interface.
Currently the only supported build backend is the **Pypa** [build](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) backend.

##### pluginÂ requirements:

- setuptools >= 42.0
- build >= 0.1.0
- pip >= 20.3
- packaging >= 20.9
- tomli >= 1.2



## python-linter plugin

Provide integration with [PyLint](https://pylint.org/) and [Flake8]([Flake8: Your Tool For Style Guide Enforcement &mdash; flake8 4.0.1 documentation](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#)) Python linters.

##### plugin requirements:

* pylint >= 2.12
* flake8

None of those linter requirements are mandatory, the plugin will check at runtime witch linter is available. You can select the linter to use in the preferences window. You can even install a new linter when builder is running (you have to close and open again the preferences window to show the new linter). For flatpack you don't have to install any linter in the gnome-builder container, instead just install as usual:

```
$ pip install flake8 --user
```

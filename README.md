# gnome-builder python plugins

## About

This project is a set of **gnome-builder** extensions targeted at Python development.

* **python-517** (a pep-517 build system)

* **python-linter** (integration of flake8 and pylint)

* **python-isort** (sort import statements)

* **python-symbol** (meaningfull symbol tree view)

After installation a new page in the preferences panel will be available with sections for the different plugins.

##### global requirements:

- gnome-builder >= 3.32
- Python >=3.6

## Installing

This project uses the [meson build system](http://mesonbuild.com/). Run the following commands to clone this project and initialize the build:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gravures/gnome-builder-python-plugins.git
$ cd gnome-builder-python-plugins
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local
```

Note: `build` is the build output directory and can be changed to any other
directory name.

To build or re-build after code-changes, run:

```
$ meson --reconfigure --prefix=~/.local build
```

To install, run:

```
$ meson compile -C build
$ meson install -C build
```

## Configurable options

##### Install python requirements for plugins

Use the **-Dpip=true** option to install python requirements. If you have a gnome-builder not running in isolation (not a flatpak), this will pip install all the requirements with the --user option in your personnal site-packages.  Otherwise if you use a flapak distribution, requirements that need to be imported by plugins will install in the gnome-builder flatpak, and ones that will be run as command will install in your personnal site-packages.

```
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local -Dpip=true
```

##### Install only specific plugins

You can specify with the **-Dplugins=true** configure option a list of plugin(s) to install:

```
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local -Dplugins=python-linter,python-517-build
```

##### Flatpak specific installation

To install plugins for a gnome-builder flatpak's distribution use the **-Dflatpak=true** option:

```
$ meson build --prefix=~/.local -Dflatpak=true -Dpip=true
$ meson compile -C build
$ meson install -C build
```

Note: this will only install certains files to the flatpak container (because thoses files can't be share with user space). 

## python-517 plugin

Provide a modern python build system defined through the [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/#build-requirements) (a build-system independent format for source trees). This is also well known as the [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) interface.
Currently the only supported build backend is the **Pypa** [build](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) backend.

##### pluginÂ requirements:

- setuptools >= 42.0
- build >= 0.1.0
- pip >= 20.3
- *packaging* >= 20.9
- *tomli* >= 1.2

## python-linter plugin

Provide integration with [PyLint](https://pylint.org/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) Python linters.

##### plugin requirements:

* pylint >= 2.12
* *or* flake8

None of those linter requirements are mandatory (they wil not be installed by the **-Dpip=true** option), the plugin will check at runtime witch linter is available. You can select the linter to use in the preferences window. You can even install a new linter when builder is running (you have to close and open again the preferences window to show the new linter). For flatpack you don't have to install any linter in the gnome-builder flatpak, instead just install as usual your prefered linter:

```
$ pip install flake8 --user
```

Of course you could install any linter's extensions you want. There is no special configurations in the preferences ui for the linters, consult linter's documentation to learn how to customize behaviours.

## python-isort plugin

[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)

Add an entry in the source view menu to sort import statements with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/index.html).

##### plugin requirements:

- isort >= 5.0

For flatpack you don't have to install isort in the gnome-builder container, instead just install as usual or use the **-Dpip=true** option.

## python-symbols plugin

Give to gnome-builder editor a meaningfull symbol code tree view.  Symbols shown in the list view can be adjusted in preferences panel (show imported modules, show variables at modules level or at class level).

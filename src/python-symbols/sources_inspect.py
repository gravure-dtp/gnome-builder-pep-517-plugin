"""sources_inspect.py

Loads a python sources file, parse it as an ast.Module
and write back pickled bytes of this ast tree to a file.
The name of this file is printed to stdout.
The call process should open as bytes the file path
read on stdout, and upickled the data read to
reconstruct the ast tree. It's the responsability
of the call process to remove te generated file on disk.
In case of errors, stdout will be empty, errors will
be logged on stderr, and the script will exit with
a status code of 1.
Warning: It is possible to crash the Python
interpreter with a sufficiently large/complex string
due to stack depth limitations in Pythonâ€™s AST compiler.
Be prepare to this with your calling process.
